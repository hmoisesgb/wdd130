            <h4>ADC</h4>
            <p>The AD Carry is responsible of dealing the most damage to enemy champions and taking down objectives such as turrets and inhibitors. They are typically paired with a support champion in the bottom lane.</p>
            <p>The AD Carry (ADC) usually is a champion whose primary role is to deal high amounts of sustained damage from a safe distance. These champions are the ones with the most damage in all the game and can greatly influence the outcome of team fights and the game as a whole.</p>

        <div id="support">
            <h4>Support</h4>
            <p>Support: The support is responsible for assisting their team by providing healing, shielding, crowd control, and vision on the map. They are also responsible for controlling the bot lane and roaming through the map to help their team secure objectives.</p>
            <p>The support needs to be aware of what's happening in other lanes and use their mobility to roam and help their teammates secure kills or objectives. The support players usually use champions to crowd control enemy champions and set up kills for their allies. They can use abilities such as stuns, slows, and knock-ups to disable enemy champions and give their team an advantage.</p>
