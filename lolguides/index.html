        <p> League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, developed by Riot Games. This game is played between two teams of five players, where each control a character with different abilities. Each character is known as champion.</p>
    
        <p>The objective of this game is to destroy the enemy team’s “Nexus”, this is a structure located at the heart of each team’s base, while defending your own. To achieve this, each player must work with one another destroying structures known as turrets and inhibitors which protect the nexus.</p>
