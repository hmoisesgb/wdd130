        League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, developed by Riot Games. This game is played between two teams of five players, where each control a character with different abilities. Each character is known as champion.</p>

      <p>The objective of this game is to destroy the enemy team’s “Nexus”, this is a structure located at the heart of each team’s base, while defending your own. To achieve this, each player must work with one another destroying structures known as turrets and inhibitors which protect the nexus.</p> 

      <p>This game offers a wide variety of champions, each with unique abilities and playstyles, providing players with a lot of different options and ways to play the game.</p>  

      <p>The map consists on 3 different lanes and a jungle. In both sides of the map there is a neutral objective, such as Dragons in the bottom side, and Rift Heralds and the Baron Nashor in the top side, which can provide great advantages to the teams that kill them.</p>  

       <p>In League of Legends, there are five main roles that players can choose to play as: Top Laner, Jungler, Mid laner, ADC and Support.</p>

      <h3>Top Laner, Jungler and Mid Laner</h3>
      <p>
        Top Lane: The top laner in League of Legends typically plays in the top lane, which is the lane that is farthest away from the Dragon and Baron pit. The role of the top laner is to provide a strong front line for their team, absorb damage, and disrupt enemy champions.
      </p>
      <p>Top laners often play champions that are durable, such as tanks or bruisers, who can survive damage and control team fights with their abilities. They are responsible for holding their own lane, pushing enemy minions, and taking down enemy turrets.</p>
      <p>Jungle: The jungler is responsible for controlling the neutral monsters in the jungle and helping their team secure objectives such as Dragon and Baron Nashor. In addition, the jungler's role involves ganking, which means attacking enemy champions in their lanes to help their team secure kills or objectives.</p>
      <p>The jungler is a key player which can greatly influence the outcome of the match by properly controlling the map and helping every player. Junglers often play champions which have a crowd-control ability (CC), this type of abilities lock down enemy champions and makes them easy to kill.</p>
      <p>Mid Lane: The role of the mid laner is to provide high damage output, control the game through their abilities, and roam to other lanes to help secure kills or objectives. As this role plays in the middle of the map, which means that they have easy access to every other lane. </p>
      <p>The mid laner is often a champion with high damage output, such as mages or assassins. They need to use their abilities to deal damage to the enemy team and control the game.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>ADC, Support and About me</h3>
      <p>AD Carry: The AD Carry is responsible of dealing the most damage to enemy champions and taking down objectives such as turrets and inhibitors. They are typically paired with a support champion in the bottom lane.</p>
      <p>The AD Carry (ADC) usually is a champion whose primary role is to deal high amounts of sustained damage from a safe distance. These champions are the ones with the most damage in all the game and can greatly influence the outcome of team fights and the game as a whole.</p>
      <p>Support: The support is responsible for assisting their team by providing healing, shielding, crowd control, and vision on the map. They are also responsible for controlling the bot lane and roaming through the map to help their team secure objectives.</p>
      <p>The support needs to be aware of what's happening in other lanes and use their mobility to roam and help their teammates secure kills or objectives. The support players usually use champions to crowd control enemy champions and set up kills for their allies. They can use abilities such as stuns, slows, and knock-ups to disable enemy champions and give their team an advantage.</p>
      <p>About me:
